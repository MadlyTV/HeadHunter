HeadHunter is a opensource discord bot that might not be the best but i can do the basic stuff

There are some stuff you need to need to do before you can use it
1. Go to the ´´´UssefullIDs.cs´´´ and change all the ´´´000000000000000000´´´ to youre ids (its easy to se what ids you need to add to what varibal)
2. Go to https://discordapp.com/developers/ and create an app with premissions and make it a bot account
3. Add that bot to your discord server and run the program now the bot should be up and running.
